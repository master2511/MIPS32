This is a RISC implementation of a subset of MIPS32 processor.
There are load/store, Arithmetic and logic instructions(with registers and immediate data), branch instructions.

The word size in memory is 32 bits in size and there are 32 general purpose register and a program counter.

The memory size is 32*1024.

simple programs like calculation of GCD to sorting algorithms can be performed on this processor.
